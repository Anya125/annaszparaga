        <h3> Welcome Stranger! </h3>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. My name is <span class="lightgreen"> Anna Szparaga </span> and I am
          currently
          looking for a job as a junior <span class="lightgreen">Frontend Developer</span>.</p>

        <p>6 years ago I turned my life upside-down and moved to Sweden. Now I am doing this again. After a couple of
          years working in customer service I decided that it is time for a change.</p>

        <p>I have always been this person who helped colleagues with their computers and I thought why not make that for
          a living? So I took a brake to learn a few frontend technologies. Right now I am ready for new challenges in
          the IT world.</p>

        <p>Feel free to check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> and if you like what you see just <a
            href="contact.html">get in
            touch with me</a>!
        </p>
